I am a PhD student at Princeton University working with Prof. [Elad Hazan](https://www.ehazan.com/).

I received my MEng in Computer Science from MIT where I worked with [Constantinos Daskalakis](https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/) and [Yuval Dagan](https://yuvaldagan.wordpress.com/). Prior to that, I graduated from MIT with a Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering.

My research interests lie broadly somewhere along the intersection of online learning, control theory and optimization.
